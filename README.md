# 🚀 My Learning Track for Java – Test Automation Journey  

I started this repository to **document my disciplined 4.5-month journey** of learning **Java for Test Automation**.  
This is not just code, it’s my **commitment to growth**, one assignment at a time, building from fundamentals to advanced OOP and automation.  

Every file here represents **daily practice, consistency, and dedication**.  
I want this repo to be transparent: recruiters can see my progress, and fellow programmers can review and appreciate my clean, structured work.
